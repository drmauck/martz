            I went to my first day of summer school extremely leery of the program. It was a one-on-one student-teacher program. It was just me and one teacher, Sue, but I immediately liked her. She was nice, fun, and a helpful type of person. Sue was the first person in my life that made English bearable. She showed me English did not have to be a torturous process and that there were even parts of English that could be fun.

           The program itself was not “intensive,” but I still had to be there daily to work on my writing. I recall one story that I had to write. It involved creating a little story book and I got to draw the pictures that went along with the story. The prompt of the story was, “what would you do if you ended up a millionaire?” I wrote and drew picture showing how I would buy a big house, a nice car, obviously lots of clothes and jewelry were involved in this story. The important part of the assignment was that Sue made writing fun. She not only brought English down to a level I felt comfortable with, but she incorporated art, a subject which I greatly enjoyed. In one moment, Sue showed me that I could write, maybe not well, but I could still do it. She was slowly building a case for English, showing me that not only that I could write, but that I should write.
