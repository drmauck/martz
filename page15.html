           Sue, the brilliant teacher that she was, turned this tribulation into a teaching moment, suggesting I should write my news article based on the near-death accident of my sandal. In agreement, I immediately put pen to paper and started brainstorming how I wanted to write my article. She managed to turn my fear of writing into excitement. By creating a fun way for me to interact with writing, Sue made English accessible, laying the foundations which were primed for more knowledge. My harrowing adventure was published in the program’s journal and I still possess a copy of that article. It was not the best piece of writing, but it is a piece of writing I am proud of. That article convinced me that I should write and if someone who failed English can write then anyone can write!

            Before summer school, I felt the way Remy did in Ratatouille, except with writing. I technically could write but I felt that I shouldn’t because I was an awful writer. With no positive reinforcement, I thought my level of writing was embarrassing. Through Sue, I learned that I could write and it did not matter at what level as long as I did it. One of the most important gifts Sue bestowed on me was her belief in me, believing in one’s ability, especially in writing, is half the battle. I did not have the confidence to write at my full potential, a problem I still struggle with to this day. I have a complicated relationship with writing, but writing is a complicated process. But if I have learned anything at all, it is to keep writing, keep questioning, keep challenging myself, and never compare my work to others…and, well, if I do that, I can’t lose because, you guessed it, anyone can write!
