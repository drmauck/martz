            Sue flew into action instead of standing in motionless horror, believing there was hope to rescue my sandal no matter how desperate the situation seemed. Looking around us, desperate, we searched for anything that could aid in our rescue attempt. The only “reasonable” object near us was an enormous broken tree branch. Sue attempted to lift the heavy decaying branch, but it was too heavy. It was a task she could not undertake alone. Thus, spurred into action, I aided in lifting the branch as we brought it close to the water’s edge. Sue took the reins, steering the branch, while I held on to the back for stabilization. We coordinated for what seemed like hours, but in reality, only minutes had passed. Our bodies were racked with anxiety as Sue dipped the branch in the water over and over again, feeling around blindly in the muddy waters below. I started to believe my precious sandal had been sacrificed to the mud gods. Sue refused to give up. After fifteen minutes, exhaustion had set in, but in a final desperate attempt we dipped the branch back down. While we moved the branch around, it snagged on something, something we could not see. Our eyes locked in both fear and hope. Sue turned around and lifted the branch ever so delicately out of the water. There, at the end of the branch, hung…seaweed and mud. But underneath that mud held a greater treasure, like a pearl in a clam, my sandal barely visible, gleamed. However, our joy was tempered due to the fear of moving the sandal to safety. Ever so slowly, Sue and I raised the long branch until it hung over wooden bridge. We dropped the branch; the utter disbelief was clear on our faces. Victory! I ran to the bridge and unearthed my sandal from its muddy prison. Holding on tight, I washed it at the edge of the water. Our trial was officially over, but the excitement of our hard-earned success continued to course through our veins. As we walked back to the main campus, we relived the glory as my foot swished with every step as a reminder.
