           Long ago when I was just a small child of six years old, I was very sickly and as such often missed weeks of school at a time. I struggled at the Catholic school I was enrolled in, particularly in English. I was sent to a special classroom with another boy in order to fill the gaps that were missing. Unfortunately, due to my illness I failed first grade and then we moved to a place called Erie in Pennsylvania where I would have to repeat first grade. However, this time, in a public school. Still, I struggled with English and writing, though I did pass first grade. It was a long time ago, but I remember school was always a struggle. I worked hard to do well but my grades in English always suffered and in turn discouraged me from trying. I figured writing was not my forte and left it at that.
